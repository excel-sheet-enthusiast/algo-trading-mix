VID 1: 
when developing trading alorithms you're trying to model and quantify reality so your algortihm can make input or connections wrt this reality. 
Data: price; time; fundamental; news data; sentiment data. 
data -> algo -> broker(via API) == direct approach
data -> algo-> manually to broker == systematic discretionary hybrid approach 

identify and edge and build strategy, edge comes first 
if a strategy achieves profitability in a certain timeframe does not mean it has an edge 

in quantitative finance, profitability is not the correct benchmark for performance, comparer to releveant benchmark which is market indexes like S&P5000(in equities)
strategy with excess returns over significant long period has an edge(alpha)

RESEARCH -> CODING -> BACKTESTING -> OPTIMIZING -> PAPER TRADING -> LIVE TRADING -> MONITORING. 
Backtesting -> insights of our strategy in past market trends. 


VID 2: 
quantconncect API 
quanntconnects lean engine automatically deals with "LOOOKAHEAD BIAS"
lookahead bias refeers to the algorithm depending on future values such as current day closing prices to rely on present prediction. 
such strategies pass the backtracking test but are useless in live markets.
